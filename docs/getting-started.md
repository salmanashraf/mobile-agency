# Getting Started

This guide walks you through using your first agent from the Mobile Dev Skill Agents toolkit.

---

## Prerequisites

You need one of:
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (recommended)
- Any LLM chat interface (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, etc.)
- An LLM API client (for automation)

No installation required. All agents are plain Markdown files.

## Your First Agent: Android Code Review

### Step 1 — Open the agent file

```
agents/android/code-reviewer/agent.md
```

### Step 2 — Copy the System Prompt

Find the `## System Prompt` section and copy the text inside the code block.

### Step 3 — Start a new session

Paste the system prompt as your first message, or in Claude Code, paste it at the start of your session.

### Step 4 — Paste your input

Use the input format from `## Input Format`. Example:

```
PLATFORM: Android
KOTLIN_VERSION: 2.0
COMPOSE_VERSION: 1.7
FILE_PATH: app/src/main/java/com/example/MainViewModel.kt
CODE:
[paste your Kotlin file here]
```

### Step 5 — Review the output

The agent returns a structured report following the `## Output Format` spec. Every finding has a severity, location, and a concrete fix.

---

## Try It With the Example Files

Each agent has a matching example file in `examples/`. To see the agent in action:

1. Open `examples/android/ProfileViewModel.kt`
2. Paste its contents as the `CODE:` field
3. Run the Android Code Reviewer agent
4. Compare your output to the example in `agents/android/code-reviewer/agent.md`

---

## Using Skills (Lighter Weight)

Skills are simpler than full agents — a single prompt module you paste into any session.

```
# Quick session
# 1. Open: skills/android/code-review.md
# 2. Copy the Skill Prompt
# 3. Paste into your LLM session
# 4. Paste your Kotlin code and ask: "Review this for the issues listed above."
```

---

## Using Prompts (Lightest)

Prompts are standalone, single-purpose prompts in `prompts/`. They require no setup:

```
cat prompts/android/explain-flow.md
# Copy, paste into your LLM, add your code, done.
```

---

## Claude Code Workflow

If you use Claude Code, the fastest workflow is:

```bash
# Start Claude Code in your project directory
claude

# In the session, reference an agent:
# "Use the system prompt from agents/android/code-reviewer/agent.md to review this file:"
# Then paste your file contents.
```

Or drop the agent system prompt into a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project to prime every session automatically.
